## Project Description
In this project, Python is used to analyze and visualize industry data and identify key trends and opportunities in the Indian startup scene. The analysis will cover funding trends, the geographic distribution of the start-ups, funding sources, and the industrial sector in which the start-ups operate. The insights gained from this project will help potential investors stay ahead of the curve and identify promising investment opportunities.Â
